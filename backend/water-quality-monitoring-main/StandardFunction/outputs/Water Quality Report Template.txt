Title: Water Quality Analysis Report
Date of Analysis: [Dynamic Date]
Generated By: [Your Application Name]
Selected Location: [Coordinates / Area Name]
1. Overview
Location: [Selected Coordinates]
Date Range: [Start Date - End Date]
Analysis Conducted on: [Generated Date]
Objective: This report provides an analysis of water quality parameters based on Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning insights.

3. AI-Generated Insights
[Insight 1: e.g., "pH levels have shown a 3% decrease over the past 6 months, which may indicate increasing pollution."]
[Insight 2: e.g., "Chlorophyll concentration has risen by 5%, suggesting an increase in algal bloom."]
[Insight 3: e.g., "Dissolved oxygen is stable, indicating a healthy aquatic environment."]

4. Graphical Analysis
(Insert dynamically generated charts here. These can be line charts, bar graphs, or heatmaps based on your collected data.)

pH Level Trends Over Time (Line Graph)
Turbidity Variation (Bar Chart)
Chlorophyll Concentration (Heatmap or Trend Line)

5. Recommendations
(Provide AI-generated suggestions based on trends. Example:)

"If pH levels continue to decline, it may be necessary to investigate industrial discharge in the region."
"Increased turbidity suggests sediment run-off; authorities may need to implement erosion control measures."

6. Conclusion
A brief summary of findings and final remarks on water quality status.

make me a python jinja template with some simple graph library based on report format provided below where i would provide data in the format given below and python scrpit would auto fill everything:

data sample:
{
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "location": "location_name"
    "values": {
            "waterParameter1": {
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123
            },
            "waterParameter2": {
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123
            },
            "waterParameter3": {
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123,
                "YYYY-MM-DD": 123
            }
        },
